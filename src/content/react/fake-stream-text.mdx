## Credit

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/) helped me write this.

## Demo

Dialog from [Dudley Do-Right](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160236/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_in_0_q_dudly%2520do).

### CSS Fade Animation (default)

<FakeTextStream
  text={`Don't try and confuse me. I know you're a vampire. And I can prove it, too, 'cause only a vampire wouldn't know the answer to this simple, Canadian question. What is Wayne gretzky's middle name? Well, I don't know, Dudley. Well, do you? No. No, I don't. Oh, my god! I am a vampire! You're not a vampire, Dudley.`}
/>

### Disable Fade Animation

<FakeTextStream
  disableFade
  text={`Don't try and confuse me. I know you're a vampire. And I can prove it, too, 'cause only a vampire wouldn't know the answer to this simple, Canadian question. What is Wayne gretzky's middle name? Well, I don't know, Dudley. Well, do you? No. No, I don't. Oh, my god! I am a vampire! You're not a vampire, Dudley.`}
/>

## Usage

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
import FakeTextStream from '@/components/fake-text-stream'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <FakeTextStream
      text={`Don't try and confuse me. I know you're a vampire. And I can prove it, too, 'cause only a vampire wouldn't know the answer to this simple, Canadian question. What is Wayne gretzky's middle name? Well, I don't know, Dudley. Well, do you? No. No, I don't. Oh, my god! I am a vampire! You're not a vampire, Dudley.`}
    />
  )
}
```

### With No Fade Animation

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
import FakeTextStream from '@/components/fake-text-stream'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <FakeTextStream
      disableFade
      text={`Don't try and confuse me. I know you're a vampire. And I can prove it, too, 'cause only a vampire wouldn't know the answer to this simple, Canadian question. What is Wayne gretzky's middle name? Well, I don't know, Dudley. Well, do you? No. No, I don't. Oh, my god! I am a vampire! You're not a vampire, Dudley.`}
    />
  )
}
```

## Source Code

```css title="src/app/globals.css"
.fade-in {
  opacity: 0;
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

```tsx title="src/components/fake-text-stream.tsx"
'use client'

import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

type FakeTextStreamProps = {
  /**
   * The text to be displayed.
   */
  text: string
  /**
   * Speed of the text stream in milliseconds.
   *
   * @default 25
   */
  speed?: number
  /**
   * Disables the fade effect when the text is fully displayed.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  disableFade?: boolean
  /**
   * Additional class names for the component.
   */
  className?: string
}

const FakeTextStream = ({ text, className, disableFade = false, speed = 25 }: FakeTextStreamProps) => {
  const [displayedText, setDisplayedText] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    // Reset text when new input is provided
    setDisplayedText('')
    let index = 0

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (index <= text.length) {
        setDisplayedText(text.slice(0, index))
        index++
      } else {
        clearInterval(interval)
      }
    }, speed)

    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }, [text, speed])

  return (
    <p className={className}>
      {displayedText.split('').map((character, index) => (
        <span
          key={index + character}
          className={cn({
            'fade-in': !disableFade,
          })}
        >
          {character}
        </span>
      ))}
    </p>
  )
}

export default FakeTextStream
```
